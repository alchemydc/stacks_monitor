# Progress

## What Works
- Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
- Documented the project overview, system architecture, technical context, and current work focus.
- Read all memory bank files.
- Implemented the Stacks API integration to fetch data via the /v2/pox endpoint and generalized the function to return all data.
- Implemented a placeholder page to display signer data
- Implemented a basic page to show POX info
- Extended the StacksAPIService to retrieve all signers for the current POX cycle
- Updated the test case to handle the possibility of the signers API returning no results
- Replaced Next.js with Vite
- Removed Tailwind CSS
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions
- Tailwind CSS has been re-installed and configured
- Removed Next.js and migrated to a plain React app
- Added a link to the POX info page from the landing page.
- Created a reusable component for styled links.
- Fixed the TypeScript errors related to the `PoxResponse` type.

## What's Left to Build

- Stacks API integration to fetch signers for a specific POX cycle from the signer API
- Build the SignerSelector component to allow users to select signers to monitor.
- Create the SignerList component to display the selected signers and their data.
- Set up the SQLite database for storing user preferences and historical data.
- AlertsPanel component
- Configuration settings
- Alert system
- Docker configuration
- Deployment pipeline

## Current Status
- The project is in the initial setup phase.
- The memory bank has been initialized with core documentation files.
- The development environment is being configured.
- A link to the POX info page has been added to the landing page.
- The POX data is now displayed correctly on the POX data page.

## Known Issues
- Signer API is currently returning http/200 but no results for the current cycle

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- TypeScript was chosen for type safety and improved developer experience.
- SQLite was selected for its simplicity and ease of use during development.
- Added "Recent Documentation Updates" section to `activeContext.md`
- Reviewed all memory bank files
