# Progress

## What Works
- Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
- Documented the project overview, system architecture, technical context, and current work focus.

## What's Left to Build
- Stacks API integration
- SignerSelector component
- SignerList component
- AlertsPanel component
- Configuration settings
- SQLite database setup
- Alert system
- Docker configuration
- Deployment pipeline

## Current Status
- The project is in the initial setup phase.
- The memory bank has been initialized with core documentation files.
- The development environment is being configured.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to use Next.js with the App Router was made to leverage server components and simplified routing.
- TypeScript was chosen for type safety and improved developer experience.
- SQLite was selected for its simplicity and ease of use during development.
