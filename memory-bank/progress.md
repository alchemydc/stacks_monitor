# Progress

## What Works
- Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
- Documented the project overview, system architecture, technical context, and current work focus.
- Read all memory bank files.
- Implemented the Stacks API integration to fetch data via the /v2/pox endpoint and generalized the function to return all data.
- Implemented a placeholder page to display signer data
- Implemented a basic page to show POX info
- Extended the StacksAPIService to retrieve all signers for the current POX cycle
- Updated the test case to handle the possibility of the signers API returning no results
- Replaced Next.js with Vite
- Removed Tailwind CSS
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions
- Tailwind CSS has been re-installed and configured
- Removed Next.js and migrated to a plain React app
- Added a link to the POX info page from the landing page.
- Created a reusable component for styled links.
- Fixed the TypeScript errors related to the `PoxResponse` type.
- Implemented the SignerSelector component to allow users to select a single signer to monitor.
- Created a new component called `SignerDetails` to show the details for a selected signer.
- Created a new API call to fetch signer metrics for a particular signer during the current cycle.

## What's Left to Build
