# Progress

## What Works
- Implemented SignerMetricsTable component with:
  - Display of all signers' metrics in the current cycle
  - Historical metrics viewing with cycle navigation
  - Direct links to individual signer detail pages
  - Responsive table design with visual status indicators
- Created the initial memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `activeContext.md`.
- Documented the project overview, system architecture, technical context, and current work focus.
- Read all memory bank files.
- Implemented the Stacks API integration to fetch data via the /v2/pox endpoint and generalized the function to return all data.
- Implemented a placeholder page to display signer data
- Implemented a basic page to show POX info
- Extended the StacksAPIService to retrieve all signers for the current POX cycle
- Updated the test case to handle the possibility of the signers API returning no results
- Replaced Next.js with Vite
- Removed Tailwind CSS
- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions
- Tailwind CSS has been re-installed and configured
- Removed Next.js and migrated to a plain React app
- Added a link to the POX info page from the landing page.
- Created a reusable component for styled links.
- Fixed the TypeScript errors related to the `PoxResponse` type.
- Implemented the SignerSelector component to allow users to select a single signer to monitor.
- Created a new component called `SignerDetails` to show the details for a selected signer.
- Created a new API call to fetch signer metrics for a particular signer during the current cycle.
- Enhanced SignerDetails component with comprehensive improvements:
  - Organized metrics into logical sections (Performance, Staking, Technical)
  - Added visual status indicators for key metrics based on thresholds
  - Implemented loading skeleton animation for better UX
  - Added robust error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Improved responsive design with grid layouts
  - Enhanced dark mode support with better contrast
  - Added proper number formatting and date localization

## What's Left to Build
- Cleaning up the app and making the UI, landing page and signer details pages more usable.
- Set up the SQLite database for storing user preferences and historical data.
- AlertsPanel component
- Configuration settings
- Alert system
- Docker configuration
- Deployment pipeline

## Current Status
- The project is in active development with core features being implemented.
- The UI is under heavy development and needs significant refinement:
  - Navigation and user flow needs improvement
  - Visual consistency across components needs work
  - Responsive design requires further testing and optimization
- The main UI components are implemented and functional:
  - POX info page displays current cycle data
  - SignerSelector allows users to choose a signer
  - SignerDetails shows comprehensive metrics with visual indicators
  - SignerMetricsTable provides overview of all signers' performance
- The Stacks API integration is working efficiently with proper error handling.

## Known Issues
- None

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- TypeScript was chosen for type safety and improved developer experience.
- SQLite was selected for its simplicity and ease of use during development.
- Added "Recent Documentation Updates" section to `activeContext.md`
- Reviewed all memory bank files
