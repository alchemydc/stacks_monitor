# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The Stacks Monitor application exists to help pool operators on the Stacks blockchain network effectively monitor and maintain their signers' performance. Pool operators need to ensure their signers meet the requirements for participation in each Proof of Transfer (PoX) cycle and maintain optimal technical performance.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Visibility Gap**: Pool operators currently lack real-time visibility into their signers' performance metrics.
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Without automated monitoring, operators may miss when their stacked STX falls below the threshold for the next PoX cycle.
3. **Performance Tracking**: Operators need to track latency and block participation rates to ensure optimal technical performance.
4. **Cycle Preparation**: Operators need timely alerts when the prepare phase of the next PoX cycle is approaching.

## How It Should Work
1. The application will connect to the Stacks signer API to retrieve data about all active signers in the current PoX cycle.
2. Users will be able to select specific signers they want to monitor.
3. The system will continuously monitor the selected signer for:
   - STX balance relative to the threshold for the next PoX cycle
   - Performance metrics including latency and rejected/missing blocks rate
   - Upcoming PoX cycle prepare phase
4. When monitored metrics fall outside acceptable thresholds, the system will send alerts to the user.
5. The user can view the details of the selected signer.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean and focused, allowing technical users to quickly access the information they need.
2. **Customizability**: Users should be able to select which signers to monitor and potentially customize alert thresholds.
3. **Reliability**: Alerts must be timely and accurate to ensure operators can take action before issues impact their participation.
4. **Actionability**: Alerts should provide clear information about what is happening and what actions may be needed.

## Target Users
The primary users are pool operators on the Stacks network who are:
- Technically proficient
- Responsible for both economic and technical performance of their pools
- Need to ensure their infrastructure meets the requirements for participation in the Stacks consensus mechanism
